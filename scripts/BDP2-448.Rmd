Reshape data to mouse-level analytic data set.
Data point at t = `r t` is used to evaluate difference between A and B bedding types.

Outcome variable is `diff`,
which is the difference between normalized food intake at t = `r t` under A-B bedding types.

* Positive values indicate the mouse ate more at t = `r t` with bedding type A
* Negative values indicate the mouse ate more at t = `r t` with bedding type B

```{r}
dfA <-
  df %>%
  filter(time == t) %>%
  filter(bedding == "A") %>%
  select(id, foodIntakeNormalized) %>%
  rename(A = foodIntakeNormalized)
dfB <-
  df %>%
  filter(time == t) %>%
  filter(bedding == "B") %>%
  select(id, foodIntakeNormalized) %>%
  rename(B = foodIntakeNormalized)
dfDiff <-
  merge(dfA, dfB, by = "id") %>%
  mutate(diff = A - B)
covariates <-
  df %>%
  filter(order == 1) %>%
  select(id, sex, order, bedding, room) %>%
  unique() %>%
  mutate(isBeddingAFirst = order == 1 & bedding == "A")
dfDiff <-
  merge(dfDiff, covariates, by = "id") %>%
  select(-c(order, bedding))
```

Exploratory comparisons.

```{r}
dfDiff %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), mean = mean(diff), sd = sd(diff)) %>%
  kable(digits = 1)
dfDiff %>%
  group_by(room) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), mean = mean(diff), sd = sd(diff)) %>%
  kable(digits = 1)
dfDiff %>%
  group_by(isBeddingAFirst) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), mean = mean(diff), sd = sd(diff)) %>%
  kable(digits = 1)
```

Models.

```{r}
M <- lm(diff ~ 1, data = dfDiff) 
M %>% tidy() %>% kable(digits = 3)
```

There appears to be **no** significant difference in the amount of food intake at t = `r t`.
Normalized food intake is higher with bedding type B by
`r M %>% tidy() %>% pull(estimate) %>% abs() %>% sprintf("%.3g", .)` mg/g
(p-value = `r M %>% tidy() %>% pull(p.value) %>% sprintf("%.2g", .)`).

```{r}
lm(diff ~ sex, data = dfDiff) %>% tidy() %>% kable(digits = 3)
lm(diff ~ room, data = dfDiff) %>% tidy() %>% kable(digits = 3)
```

The difference is still not significant after adjusting for sex or room.

```{r}
M <- lm(diff ~ isBeddingAFirst, data = dfDiff)
M %>% tidy() %>% kable(digits = 3)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
betaA <- lm(diff ~ !isBeddingAFirst, data = dfDiff) %>% tidy() %>% filter(term == "(Intercept)")
betaB <- lm(diff ~  isBeddingAFirst, data = dfDiff) %>% tidy() %>% filter(term == "(Intercept)")
```

However, the difference appears to depend on which bedding type the mouse experiences first.
Mice that experience bedding type A first have higher food intakes at t = `r t` with bedding type A:
`r betaA %>% pull(estimate) %>% abs() %>% sprintf("%.3g", .)` mg/g
(p-value = `r betaA %>% pull(p.value) %>% sprintf("%.2g", .)`)
Mice that experience bedding type B first have higher food intakes at t = `r t` with bedding type B:
`r betaB %>% pull(estimate) %>% abs() %>% sprintf("%.3g", .)` mg/g
(p-value = `r betaB %>% pull(p.value) %>% sprintf("%.2g", .)`)

This suggests that a crossover design might not be the most optimal study design for this research question.

An alternative analysis is to assume a model that ignores the cross-sectional study design.
Instead, the model includes `order` as a fixed effect and an interaction between `bedding` and `order`.
The model also includes a random intercept effect for mouse.

```{r}
dfRanEff <-
  df %>%
  filter(time == t) %>%
  select(id, foodIntakeNormalized, order, bedding, sex, room) %>%
  mutate(order = factor(order))
dfRanEff %>%
  group_by(bedding, order) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), mean = mean(foodIntakeNormalized), sd = sd(foodIntakeNormalized)) %>%
  kable(digits = 1)
lmer(foodIntakeNormalized ~ bedding + order + bedding * order + (1 | id), 
     data = dfRanEff) %>% 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  kable(digits = 3)
```


R session information.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sprintf("Run time: %s", Sys.time())
print(sessionInfo(), locale = FALSE)
```
